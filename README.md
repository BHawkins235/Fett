## 📘 Description

**Fett** is a lightweight Python utility designed to extract and analyze **file metadata** from a wide range of file types.  
It provides a clean interface for retrieving attributes such as creation dates, modification timestamps, file size, MIME type, and additional metadata when available (EXIF, file headers, etc.).

This project aims to serve as a reliable and extensible foundation for:

- Forensic or cybersecurity workflows  
- File auditing and inspection  
- Automation scripts that process directory structures  
- Metadata validation or reporting tools  

Whether you're scanning files manually or integrating metadata extraction into another tool, **Fett** provides a straightforward, modular way to do it.
